title: All Hands meeting
---
Every month, we hold an All Hands meeting. These meetings are used to:

- give a general update on the status of Nebulab;
- introduce new team members;
- present any important updates to the playbook.

You are strongly encouraged to attend so that you can ask questions and spend some virtual
bonding time with the entire team, but in case you're not able to, the meetings are recorded.

The agenda of these meetings is in Tadum, where we will also leave links to any useful resources
you can reference (such as any playbook pages that might have changed).

## Organizing an All Hands

All Hands events need some work from the meeting organizer both to prepare the meeting content and
to be sure everyone is aware of the meeting and what to expect from it. If you are in charge of
organizing the All Hands, simply follow these tips to make it a success!

### One day before the meeting

- **Prepare the agenda.** Prepare the agenda in Tadum, listing any topics that will be discussed
  during the event. This is important so everyone is allowed to take a look and ask for
  clarifications about topics or propose additional topics.
- **Notify the team.** Once the agenda is ready, send a message into the #all-hands Slack channel to
  let everyone know that the meeting will be tomorrow and that they can read the agenda in advance.

### The day of the meeting

- **Notify the team.** Send another message in the #all-hands Slack channel to let everyone know the
  meeting time. This message can be used to remind people of important things like why attendance
  (and being on time) are important, how to join the meeting and how to ask questions.

#### After the meeting

After the meeting the organizer needs to close the agenda on Tadum and add any topics to be
discussed in the next meeting.

### Pro-tip: Slack reminders

Organizers can use the following Slack reminders to remind them of any actions they need to take
to organize All Hands meetings:

- `/remind me to "Send Slack reminder for All Hands (meeting is tomorrow)" next Thursday 15pm every 4 weeks`
- `/remind me to "Send Slack reminder for All Hands (meeting is Today)" next Friday 10am every 4 weeks`
- `/remind me to "Close All Hands agenda" next Friday 17pm every 4 weeks`

Please note that these commands need to be run **no later than Thursday during the the week of the
meeting**.
