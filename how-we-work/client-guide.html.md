title: Client guide

Hello! Welcome to Nebulab's client guide. This guide will explain what it is like to work with us
and how to structure our relationship for success! By the end of the guide you should have a solid
understanding of our tools and practices but, most importantly, you will understand _why_ we work 
the way we do.   

## Onboarding process

The onboarding process consists of six different steps:

1. **Kick-off call:** During this call we'll get to know each other. We'll introduce ourselves, our
   tools and our processes. We will also ask you to explain your project's goals and current work
   methodology (if any) and what you expect from us.
2. **Project evaluation:** After the kick-off call, we'll ask for access to any existing materials
   that might help us understand whether your project is a good fit for us. These might be 
   functional specifications, a project management tool, or your existing codebase. We're happy to
   sign an NDA if needed. We can provide
   [a sample NDA](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/raw/master/assets/nda-draft.pdf) - if you
   need any adjustments to it just let us know.
3. **Negotiation and contract:** If we determine that we can provide value to your project, we'll
   send you an overview of the resources we expect will be needed to accomplish the required goals,
   along with their cost. If everything looks alright to you, we'll send you a contract to sign.
   [Here's a sample contract](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/raw/master/assets/contract-draft.pdf).
4. **Tool onboarding:** Once the contract is signed, we will ask you to provide access to all the
   tools we will need to use to work on your project. Typically, these include your preferred
   communication tool (we prefer Slack, but other tools work too), your current project management 
   system (if you have one) and your version control system (we usually go with GitHub).  
5. **Team meeting:** At this point, we'll set up a meeting with your new team and ask you to bring
   any members of your team that will interact frequently with the developers. We'll get to know
   each other and make sure there aren't any blockers to starting the development. 
6. **Development kick-off:** Once we're all set, we'll start working on your project!

If you need to scale your team up, we will simply repeat steps 4-6.

## How we work

Here are a few notes on the way we work. Please read these carefully: we're a bit unconventional in
certain aspects and we want to make sure you're aware of (and onboard with!) our practices.

#### We work 4 days a week

That's right. We only work Monday-Thursday, while Friday is reserved for studying, team-building 
and open-source work. While we understand that this might be a challenge in some situations, we 
strongly believe that having time to learn new tools and technologies should not come at the 
expense of our developers' work/life balance, which is why we allocate 20% of the week to learning. 

If you're curious about what your team is doing in their personal investment time, just ask them! 
They'll be happy to share.
  
#### We work at a sustainable pace

The best developers come to Nebulab because it's a place where you get to do your best work without 
burning out. "Sustainable pace" means no all-nighters, no unrealistic expectations and no weekend 
work. We only work 9am-6pm Central European Time. 

We will happily accommodate a late meeting if it's caused by timezone differences or real urgency, 
and we will put in extra effort to help you get things done before that big event, but we won't pull 
a 12-hour day at a moment's notice.

#### We keep things lean

When you reach out to us, you will speak to a developer, not a sales rep. When you plan the 
development roadmap, you will do it with a developer, not a project manager. When you need to scale 
your team up (or down), you will ask a developer, not an account manager. See the pattern? 

We won't add any extra layers of bureaucracy on our end, and we expect you to do the same: keep 
things as human and straightforward as possible to improve development velocity and developer 
happiness. Don't worry, we'll help you in the process!

#### We don't like (useless) deadlines

If you have a real deadline, we will do whatever we can to accommodate it. A real deadline is one
that is motivated by a real-world event: perhaps you're changing warehouses and you need the new 
integration to be ready by the time you move, or you have a big marketing event coming up and you 
want people to see your shiny redesign. However, what we don't like is spending more time on 
estimating and putting dates on features than doing actual work. 

Most of the time, we work without deadlines, and things take as long as they need to take to be done 
properly. We know this might be uncomfortable for some, so we ask you to give it a spin and see how 
it works for your project.

#### We only bill for the time we work

We're very big on transparency here, which is why we will only bill you for the hours we've actually 
spent on your project, regardless of what was agreed upon. That means if you tell us you need 120 
hours/month, but we only manage to do 100, we'll bill you for 100 hours. If you want, we will also 
provide you with a report of _how_ those hours were spent and by whom (in fact, we have a client 
dashboard to do just that!). 

We're constantly looking for ways to improve the accuracy of our time tracking, so that you can 
sleep knowing you're getting the best possible value for your money.

#### We are opinionated

If we think that there is a better way to do things, we will tell you, whether that's about your 
planning process or the actual features you want to implement. 

That also means we expect you to be actively involved in the development of your product and be 
aware of what we're doing, not just assigning features to people. We believe that you're not just 
paying for our development work, but also for our experience and advice.

## FAQs

#### What if I need 40 hours/week?

If you need 40 hours/week or more, you always have the option of adding a developer to your project.
In fact, we usually recommend at least two developers per project, so that they can discuss issues 
and solutions and provide feedback to each other.

With that said, many clients who initially thought they needed 5 full days of work per week were 
surprised to find out that 4 days were more than enough to maintain a good pace. Before you ask for 
another developer, we ask you to consider whether you need it (also keep in mind our minimum 
engagement policy).

Long story short: if you _really_ have the space and requirement for an additional person, we'll be 
very happy to provide one. Otherwise, we suggest sticking to the 4-day schedule for a while to see 
how it works for you. 

#### What is your minimum engagement?

Our minimum engagement for a developer is 2 days/week with a strong preference for 4 days/week in
order to maintain context switching to a minimum.

The ideal engagement (for both us and you) is at least 2 developers at 4 days/week, so that the 
developers can support each other and you always have a second opinion on any technical concerns. 

#### What time is billable and what time isn't?

We'll bill you for any time spent actively working on your project. That includes development, 
testing, feature planning and meetings related to development work.

We will never bill you for sales-related meetings or any other casual conversations around your
project and we will not bill you for any interruptions in our developers' 8-hour workday.

#### Do you provide team augmentation?

Yes! Many of our clients have their in-house development team whom we collaborate with, while others
outsource all their development needs to us. Whatever you need, we can handle it!

#### How much involvement do you expect from me?

We ask clients to provide at least one person that will discuss priorities and requirements with our
team and provide information about your business concepts. We need your help to do our best work.
