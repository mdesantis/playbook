title: Where, when and how
---
Our working day consists of four days devoted to work for external clients (not necessarily always 
with the same client) and one day, [Friday](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/personal-growth/fridays.md), 
dedicated exclusively to learning, internal projects or open source contributions.

We work an 8-hour day, though these are reasonably flexible. In any case, legally, you cannot exceed
13 hours a day or 48 hours a week. The hours adopted by most of us is between 9:30 AM and 6:30 PM, 
considering about an hour for lunch. Work organization must, in any case, be a team effort: those 
who choose to work at different hours must be careful not to prevent others from performing their
work.

In terms of place, the flexibility is even higher. Nebulab currently has two operative offices, one 
in Pescara and one in Latina, but you are free to work from anywhere you want (including your home).

This flexibility in terms of time and place is possible thanks to the discipline of our team and
continuous and attentive use of ad hoc tools.

## Remote work

As mentioned above, it is possible at any time (with advance notice) to choose to work remotely for
a determined period of time or indefinitely. At Nebulab, we strongly believe in the remote-first
philosophy, as it not only improves the productivity of individuals who are in an environment most
congenial to them, but especially instills the habit of continuous communication and transparency.
After all, we work remotely for all our clients!

That said, remote work comes with serious challenges that must be handled in advance, to prevent
them from negatively affecting your productivity and that of the entire team. In this section, we
explain some of these challenges and how they can be overcome.

### Basic principles

First of all, we must always remember some basic principles when we work remotely:

- Remote work is not simply a benefit, but a philosophy in itself and an alternative to co-located
  work. As such, it should be approached with the same focus and care we use when working from the
  office.
- Remote work requires the collective effort of those who work remotely and those who work from the
  office. If one of these two groups is not sufficiently involved, it will not work.
- A well-implemented remote-first philosophy improves everyone's work quality, bringing calmness and
  transparency to communication, decisions and daily work.
- If you are working remotely, you are at the office. If you need to do anything else, inform the
  team and ask for permission. Working while you are doing something else is _not_ acceptable,
  because it affects not only your productivity, but also the productivity of those you work with.
- Adopt transparency by default. Ensure that all communication takes place in public channels, 
  unless it is strictly necessary to keep it private, so that everyone is informed on what is
  happening.

### Work space

Our work space is our temple. This applies both to co-located and remote work. The difference is
that, while the office is a space where we all create a comfortable work environment, when you work 
remotely, it is up to you to ensure you have the tools and the environment to be as productive as
possible.

Here is a list of essential things for working remotely:

- **Your productive space.** A space dedicated exclusively to work. When you are there, you are at
  the office. This space must be specific, quiet, free of distraction and other people.
- **A good Internet connection.** It is frustrating to be in a meeting with someone you can't
  understand or who disconnects continuously. If you intend to work remotely, invest in a good
  Internet connection. If you need help, we can find a solution together.

### Communication channels

We use the Slack channel #calendario for all communications regarding working time and place. If you
intend to work remotely, communicate this as early as possible.
 
**Important: DO NOT use private messages or unofficial channels for this type of communication!**
It is important to keep them centralized and accessible.

### Exceptions

Life is complicated and things happen. We all need to make a small exception to the rule every now
and then. Perhaps someone in your family is sick and nobody can take care of them, but you don't
want to take a whole day off. **Communication** is the key in such situations. Inform others that
you will be working remotely but may not be accessible at all times; nobody will object.

In any case, if situations of this type happen often, talk to us and we will find a solution  
together.
