We have two solutions for listening to the music, depending on the office: 

* Pescara: a Bowers & Wilkins Z2 system supporting AirPlay. It can be used with the standard
  systems [provided by Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202809).
* Latina: a Sonos sound system projected in the office rooms. With Sonos, you can manage various
  distributed playlists or combine the speakers to play the same music on several speakers. You can
  manage the system by installing the app for your own devices (desktop/mobile) directly from
  [Sonos site](https://www.sonos.com/redir/controller_software_mac).

Out of respect for others, please avoid extreme musical genres at all costs, such as Norwegian death
metal, rap, trap or pop trash such as Nicki Minaj.
