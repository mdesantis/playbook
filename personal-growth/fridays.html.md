# Fridays

Fridays are our time for personal and collective growth. On Fridays, we do not work on clients.
Instead, we focus on initiatives that improve our skills or contribute to the community or the
company. Here are some ideas for Friday work:

- Write a post for our [blog](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/blob/master/working-on-nebulab/blog.md)
- Contribute to an open source project
- Study a new tool/technology
- Come up with a tweet to publish
- Follow an online course
- Mentor a teammate and teach them a skill

If you come up with an idea and you're not sure whether it's a good candidate for Friday time, your
mentor will be able to help you.

## Demo Fridays

Every three months, we host a Demo Friday. We all get on a video call and present our work to the 
company in a series of 5-minute lightning talks. If needed, your mentor will help you prepare for 
this demo, but as a rule of thumb keep it simple and you'll be fine!

Demo Fridays are recorded in case anyone was not able to attend but still wants to know what the
rest of the team is up to. 

To know when the next Demo Friday will be hosted, please take a look at your Nebulab calendar. You 
should find a recurring event shared with everyone in the company. 

## Reconciling client work and Friday time

Our first responsibility is towards our amazing clients, who have been kind enough to give up 20%
of the workweek so that we could focus on our growth.

If, for any reason, you were not able to provide the allotted amount of hours, you will need to make
up for the lost time on Friday. This rule usually includes any work time that is lost because of
national holidays, conferences, retreats or paid time off.

There might also be sensitive periods of the year (e.g. the days immediately before and after Black
Friday and Cyber Monday) during which clients might need more support than usual, in which case we
will temporarily give up our Friday time to ensure they have all the help they need.
