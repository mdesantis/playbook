# Our values

All of us, in our work, have direct relations with colleagues and stakeholders, such as clients,
other development teams, members of the OSS community and other professionals. The relationship
established with them is fundamental: we must always keep in mind all the values and standards that
Nebulab aims to represent and uphold.

Working at Nebulab means investing in an all-round collaboration context. It is essential to support
one another as well as coordinate with each other in an attempt to compensate any shortcomings of
other team members.

All that we want to be is described on our website. Anyone contacting us expects to deal with
people who are:

- passionate about the Web;
- expert in their field, but open to change;
- developing high-quality products;
- solving problems without getting lost in irrelevant details;
- nerds, but communicative;
- dedicated to work, but easy-going;
- willing to experiment and share.

These expectations are reflected in our values, which are reported below along with some exemplary
behaviors.

## Honesty

- We work honestly.
- We act and communicate in a sincere, loyal and transparent way.
- We don't look for convenient solutions.
- We express our perplexities if a decision may damage the project, even indirectly.
- We only bill the hours that were actually worked on the project.

## Communication

- We say hi via the project's communication channel at the beginning and at the end of the day.
- We always communicate clearly, simply and precisely.
- We use humor when appropriate.
- We provide all the information that can be useful to the client or other members of the team, even
  if it's simply a summary of what we are doing or will do today.
- We report doubts and problems.
- We keep our project management tools and client's tools updated.
- We promptly record the hours worked.
- We communicate in a timely fashion, delegating or postponing only when we cannot provide an
  immediate response.

## Collaboration

- We help others grow enable them to help others in turn.
- We understand that productivity depends on our team's talent and their capacity to collaborate,
  and we constantly try to improve both aspects.
- We do not solve problems alone, even if we were capable of doing so.
- We are patient when teaching others and we try to adapt to their learning style instead of
  adapting them to our teaching style.
- We operate with high standards and politely expect others to do the same.

## Problem owning

- We pay the necessary attention to problems, finding a compromise between technical perfection and
  the value that our solution brings to the project.
- With regard to our clients, we always act as if we were spending our own money, not theirs.
- We ensure that the problems we face do not happen again.
- We are pragmatic and focus on details instead of high-level technicalities.
- We take a critical approach to problems, finding and suggesting the best solution.

## Growth

- We face challenges instead of avoiding them.
- We treat criticism as an opportunity to grow.
- We are inspired by the success of others and imitate them.
- We cultivate the aspects we want to improve in ourselves.
- We treat our defects as opportunities for improvement instead of hiding them.
