As you may have noticed on Slack or GitHub, we all have similar profile pictures. The pictures are
also used on our site in the Team section of the page [About Us](https://nebulab.it/about-us/). 
You will be included in the list once you have yours.

This is a picture of the photo set that we usually use to take the photos.

There is no need to create an exact reproduction of this set. It is only provided as an example. All
we require is for your photo to be consistent with the others. Here is the result of the photo:

These assets must be provided to Davide (@davidedistefano), who is in charge of post-production to finalize the photo:
