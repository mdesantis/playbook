title: Resignation
---
The employment contract provides the worker with the option of withdrawing unilaterally from the
contract by submitting his/her resignation. The [resignation processes](https://www.cliclavoro.gov.it/Cittadini/Pagine/Adempimenti.aspx)
is remote and can be sent in various ways:

- Autonomously, on the [clicklavoro.gov.it website](http://clicklavoro.gov.it) for all those who 
  have INPS access credentials. Below is a link to a useful
  [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/02yuLr7-h_E);
- By going to authorized entities, such as patronages, trade union organizations, certification
  commissions, bilateral entities, and, with the introduction of Legislative Decree 185/2016, also 
  labor consultants and territorial offices at the National Labor Inspectorate ("Ispettorato
  Nazionale del Lavoro").

The resignation must be given with sufficient advance notice, variable depending on contract type as
well as employment length and level. It is usually 20-30 days, but please check your individual 
case.
