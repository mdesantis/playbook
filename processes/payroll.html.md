Salaries are paid via bank transfer by the tenth day of each month. The thirteenth month is paid in
December, while the fourteenth is paid in June.

The payslip showing all the various amounts for the month or additional months can be found in the
private `Buste Paga` folder in our Google Drive until 12/2018 or in the documents section of 
Dipendenti in Cloud starting from 01/2019.
