title: Workplace health and safety

Both of our offices comply with current Italian workplace health and safety standards.

It is unproductive and certainly unhealthy to remain seated in the same position for eight hours or
more.  We strongly encourage all members of our team to take regular breaks of at least 15 minutes
every two hours of continuous work in front of a computer. During these breaks it's good to get up
and walk away from your workstation and perform other activities, such as having coffee or tea,
having a snack, taking a walk or walking a dog.

We recommend using [flexbot](http://www.flexbot.ai/), a Slack bot that can help you practice these
activities regularly.
