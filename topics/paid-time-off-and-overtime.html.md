# Paid time off and overtime

The work day for full-time contracts is comprised of 8 hours. You can decide to reduce your
contract's work hours and opt for part-time work.

Vacation and residual leave hours can be viewed in your payroll slip:

- vacation days, in the box `FERIE RES.`;
- holiday hours (or former Public Holidays), in the box `FEST. RES.`;
- work time reduction hours (or ROL), in the box `ROL RES.`

The same applies to the quantities earned and used, displayed in the same box corresponding to 
`MAT.` and `GOD.`. The acronym `A.P.` stands for Anno Precedente (i.e. previous year) and indicates
the amounts corresponding to the previous year, but which can still be taken.

## Vacations

There are 22 days of vacation per year (176 hours). All members of the team must communicate the
vacations days they wish to take via chat or verbally, with a notice of at least two weeks if
possible. 

## Time off, special leave and overtime

The annual number of hours for time off depends on how long you've been with us.

| Length of service       | Hours/Year |
|-------------------------|------------|
| 0 - 24                  |    32      |
| 25 - 48                 |    60      |
| >48                     |    88      |

Another type of paid leave is when it is granted in special cases. Below is a non-exhaustive list:

- birth;
- marriage;
- death of relatives up to the second level;
- blood donation.

If you think you have the right to paid leave, write to the administrative manager (@mettiu), who
will check this for you.

Overtime is a working time in excess of the 8 hours a day. By law it is not allowed, under any
circumstances, to exceed the limit of 48 hours a week.

### Compensation and rounding-off

All overtime hours and time off in the month will be compensated at the end of the month. The
balance will then be rounded-up to the nearest half-hour by applying the following rules:

- from 0 to 0.249 = 0;
- from 0.25 to 0.749 = 0.5;
- from 0.75 to 1 = 1

and so on.

## Sick leave

For communications regarding sick leave, employees must contact their physician to request a sick 
leave certificate. The physician will send the certificate electronically to INPS, which, in turn, 
will make it available in electronic form. Based on the sick leave days granted by the attending 
physician, the employee must  communicate to the company the days of absence together with the
certificate's unique code.

# Permit type

When deciding which type of permit to ask for, adopt the following rules:

- `Permessi/Ferie` is used for time off hours or vacation days: therefore, you can use it for
  whole days off or by putting in the number of hours of time off; 
- `Malattia` is used in case of sick leave, **inserting the Protocol Code in the notes issued by the
  attending physician**;
- `Permesso straordinario` is used for time off granted in special cases listed in the section
  [Time off, special leave and overtime](#time-off-special-leave-and-overtime).
