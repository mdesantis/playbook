# Hiring

We are always looking for people who share our values, the desire to work in a team and the passion
to face new challenges every day.

For Nebulab, hiring means, on one hand, contributing to the success of our mission, by increasing
our capacity to:

- satisfy the clients in terms of work volume and quality; 
- attract new developers;
- create high-quality software;
- produce content that contributes to our personal growth and the growth of Nebulab as a company.

On the other hand, each time we hire, we commit to making the individual grow in an environment that
contributes to their personal and professional success, making them happy and fulfilled.

We have a responsibility towards all those involved in this project to create a cohesive and
functional team, so we put a lot of effort into selecting new members of the team. This is why we
created a hiring process that must be adhered to as closely as possible, in order to avoid bias and
subjective choices.

## Selection phases

### Initial contact

Hi! 

This first contact gives us an idea if there is a cultural and technical fit that will allow us 
to start to get to know each other. Usually, we find candidates in one of the following ways:

- by referral (for example, your former colleague who now works for us);
- from GitHub, LinkedIn or Stack Overflow searches;
- from the form on our [Careers](https://nebulab.it/careers/) page.

If you are applying for a job, complete the form providing some information about yourself, your
experience with software development and with [the tools we use](https://nebulab.it/tools/), your
approach to work and why you are interested in Nebulab.

Someone from our team will read your letter and, if they think you might be a good candidate, they
will write to you to find the best time for an [informal chat](#informal-chat).

### Informal chat

This is a phone call or video call where we will explain the Nebulab values, our needs and the way 
we work. We will also ask you to explain what are you looking for in your ideal work environment and
why you think that Nebulab would be a good choice.

This chat should help us understand whether we would like to work together and meet daily in a work
context.

In this phase there are no specific questions: we avoid formalities, we talk about a bit of 
everything and see how we feel about each other.

Some advice for the chat:

* **Be on time.** This is extremely important and is an indicator of your professionalism: just 
  being on time will give you an advantage on many candidates.
* **Be equipped.** Make sure you have a good Internet connection, a good headset and a good camera.
  And please, find a quiet place to call from!
* **Turn up prepared.** You already know that we will talk about Nebulab and about you, so prepare
  some questions about us and some answers about yourself!
* **Be yourself.** The get-to-know meeting is meant to help understand what type pf person you are
  and how you can fit in the company. We cannot do that if you pretend to be someone else.
* **Relax.** We are humans. None of us is an HR manager or has a psychology degree. Think, behave
  and talk as you would do normally.

### Aptitude questionnaire

After the chat, we will send you an aptitude questionnaire, which we will use to assess how you work
and some basic technical skills. The questionnaire will be sent to you as a Google document, which
you can complete at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that you tell us when we can expect your
answers, so we can do a better job of coordinating our hiring efforts.

The fundamental requirement in answering the questionnaire is sincerity: write in accordance with
your values and the way you work, not what you think we would like to hear from you. The purpose of
the questionnaire is to understand whether you're a good cultural and technical fit, so it is in
everyone's interest that the answers reflect the way you really work and handle problems as much as
possible.

Don't hesitate to ask clarifications on questions or technical issues in case anything is not clear
to you, and don't be afraid to hit a wrong note: in the past, some of the most striking answers
were completely out of tune, perhaps mentioning aspects outside of the work context, but they 
allowed us to perfectly understand the person on the other end of the screen.

### Technical assessment

If you have reached this stage, it means we think you may be a good candidate for our selection
process. We are sure that working with you would be a pleasure.

Usually this meeting takes place via a video call or in person, depending on how far you are from
our offices. If we meet in person, please note that there is no dress code to respect and a t-shirt
or a hoodie will not make you lose any points, given that we will probably wear one too!

The objective of this step is to understand your level in relation to other members of our team.
Understanding this will help us formulate an offer corresponding to your abilities, so if we haven't
talked about this yet, feel free to tell us about your possible compensation expectations. This step
will also help us to understand your attitudes and future potential.

Don't think of the technical interview as the classic interview where you are asked embarrassing
questions on algorithms you should know by heart or to program in front of us. Instead, we just want
to be sure that your level of experience is coherent with our expectations, so feel at ease: nobody 
here manages to solve major problems without checking manuals, articles and Stack Overflow.

The technical assessment will usually consist of a feature, enhancement or bugfix on a real project
from one of our clients, which will be selected according to your role and experience. Here are some
tips to help you excel:

- Pay attention to documentation and Git history.
- Follow the conventions established on the project.
- If in doubt, feel free to ask! You have our full support.
 
If we don't hire you, we will pay for your work at our standard rate for external consultants, which
will be shared when the task is assigned to you.

### Offer

We will contact you to let you know to let you know what salary level we have in mind for you.
The offer often comes with a series of objectives, which we will agree upon with you based on your
level and the offer formulated.

Feel free to let us know if you disagree, and we will try to find some middle ground. We are ready
to adjust our offer if we have set objectives that are either too low or overly ambitious.

## Process duration

Usually the whole hiring process takes one month, but it could take longer depending on the number
of candidates in our pipeline and other commitments of the team working on your assessment.
