## Readme

A good readme is fundamental for a project's health, because it allows new developers to start 
working on the code quickly, without having to ask others how to configure the application or the
development environment. Ideally, the readme should contain all of the following points:

- a short description of the project;
- instructions on how to install the project for local development;
- any guidelines that have been adopted for the code;
- the workflow for the development of new features;
- any external tools that are used (for example: SendGrid, Honeybadger);
- the project's deployment workflow.

For inspiration on readme structure and content, you can look at some of the existing projects or 
ask in #development.
