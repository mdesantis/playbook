Everyone is free to contribute to [our blog](https://nebulab.it/blog/), which is run and managed by 
our marketing team.
  
The blog is our way of contributing to the software industry as well as a way of making ourselves
known to potential clients. Moreover, writing is also an excellent way to deeply understand topics
we are studying and to make clarity on problems we are facing (for example, Friday time projects
make excellent articles!).

Note that we have a #blogposts channel in Slack that you can and should join if you're working or
plan to work on an article. It's an amazing place to get some feedback, tips, or just the occasional
confidence boost!

When you have a final draft, ping @shana.remigio in the #blogposts channel. She runs the
blog and will provide a final review to ensure the article is in line with our SEO strategy. She
will also ask our designers to whip up an artsy cover.

## Guidelines for writing

Here are some tips for writing good articles:

- Keep it short. The ideal article is 400-600 words long. Longer articles are beautiful but they are
  time and effort intensive - they should be the exception, not the rule.
- Stay practical. There's no need to overdo it and get philosophical. Write about an issue you have
  faced recently or a new tool you're experimenting with. If it helps others, it's fair game.
- Get it done. It's easy to obsess over small details if you're not used to writing. Even if you
  hate what you wrote, finish it and get someone to review it.
- More tips can be found in our [article template][template].

If you follow these rules, you should be able to produce an article in 8 hours. If it's taking
longer than 8 hours, you should probably reach out to your mentor, who will help you figure out any
issues you might be having!

## Publishing frequency

A fundamental aspect of maintaining the blog is to ensure new content is published on a regular
basis. We currently try to publish an article every two weeks and any surplus articles are queued.
